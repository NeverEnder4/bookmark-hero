# Bookmark Hero

Bookmark Hero is a chrome extension for browsing and opening all bookmarks in a given folder.

## Installation

Clone Github repo

Open Chrome and navigate to the [Chrome extension manager](chrome://extensions/).

Make sure developer mode is toggled on (top right corner).

Click load unpacked and select the cloned repo's directory.

Now you can click the newly unpacked extension's icon to open it (as you would a regular extension).

Click the refresh button on the Bookmark Hero card in the Chrome extension manager to update changes made to the code (make sure to also clear any errors).
